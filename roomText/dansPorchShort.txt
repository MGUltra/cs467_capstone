| A lawn chair overlooks an unkempt backyard. Two empty beer        \    /    |
| bottles and a crumpled piece of paper lay next to the chair.       |18|     |
| Some tools are scattered about as well. A crescent wrench          |  |     |
| wrapped in a rag lies a bit further than the rest. The Eastern     |  |     |
| door leads into the bedroom - to the South the kitchen.            |  |     |
