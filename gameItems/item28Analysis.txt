| The lab analysis confirms that the locket has been on the statue for a    	|
| long time. The skin in the dust is only Vince's and there is no DNA from    |
| Emma left on the locket or chain. Neither has been cleaned, so if this      |
| was Emma's locket, it hasn't been worn by her for years.							      |
