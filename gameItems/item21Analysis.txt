| The lab safety manual is technically required reading for all police who    |
| work with the crime lab in any capacity. Ironically, the cover features a   |
| cartoon character drinking out of lab glassware with an big X striking him  |
| out, as if to say, Do not do this. The lab confirmed that this is a genuine |
| copy of the lab safety manual. The techs seemed annoyed at that assignment. |
