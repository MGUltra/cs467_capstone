| These letters are a series of what can only be described as love letters     |
| addressed to Carl, but signed only with a heart. The letters seemed to be    |
| responding to asked questions and comments, suggesting that these letters    |
| were a back and forth communication between Carl and a secret love interest. |
| Analyzing them at the lab may lead to more information.                      |
