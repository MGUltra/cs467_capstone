| "Listen here Vincent. You may think I'm just some old pushover and you can  |
| get away with not given me my cut, but you've got another thing coming. I   |
| gave you a good tip, and you either let me wet my beak in the winnings or   |
| you'll have some unpleasentness coming your wait. Do not doubt me."         |
|                                                                             |
