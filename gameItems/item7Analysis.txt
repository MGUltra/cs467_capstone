| This lab confirms this was a budget made for Carl. It includes a mortgage		 |
| payment that differs from the one he currently pays, so it would back up the |
| story that Louise is his realtor and helping him close on a new house, if it |
| didn't also include the budgeting for living expenses for another adult and  |
| an infant. There is clearly something they are not telling you. You may want |
| to ask them about this.																											 |
