| The lab has determined that the person who wrote these letters was none other|
| than Louise. The DNA pulled from saliva from one of the lipstick kisses she  |
| left on some of the letters matched the sample she provided us with. There   |
| were also several fingerprints that matched Louise and Carl, suggesting they |
| were the only ones who touched the letters.																	 |
