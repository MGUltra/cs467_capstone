| "Of course I know Vince - he's one of my regulars. Well, regular at showing |
| up to the fights, not so regular in paying up when he owes me. He was at    |
| the fight last night - placed a few bets but slipped out after his last     |
| fighter lost. The seat next to him, Emma's seat, was empty all night."      |
