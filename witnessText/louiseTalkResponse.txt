| "I've known Carl for several years. We originally met when My husband was   |
| broadcasting his championship Golden Gloves match. There were many media    |
| events surrounding that and after and we struck up a friendship since my    |
| father would always talk boxing with me since my mother didn't like it. I'd |
| grown to love the sport. Recently I've been helping Carl look for a new     |
| home since he was in the market, and we are about to close on a new place,  |
| which is why I was at his place. I wasn't feeling so hot so after signing   |
| the papers closing the deal, so I went home shortly after that.             |
