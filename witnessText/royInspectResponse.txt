| A man in his mid forties - tufts of gray sprout from his brown hair. He     |
| wears a white button-up with a vest, slacks, and polished Italian loafers.  |
| Roy "works" at the Horseshoe Casino, that is to say he is a go between for  |
| the mob, working as a bookie taking side action, and using inside info to   |
| place bets for higher ups in the organization. The horseshoe benefits from  |
| the relationship because the mob funnels high rollers into the casino. The  |
| skim is more than made up for through the whale's losses. Roy and Emma have |
| a past connection through clubs she sings at that are connected as well, but|
| there is evidence that he was also in the dirt on this latest prize fight   |
| with Vince. There's a dead woman and lots of money in Roy's orbit and he is |
| currently being less than helpful. find some hard evidence to break him.    |
