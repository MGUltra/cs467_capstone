| Loiuse is an attractive middle aged woman. She sits in the police station   |
| with the confidence of a woman who knows she can afford the best legal team |
| that money can buy. She has been married to Garvin Mathis, the media mogul  |
| for many years, and has had to deal with the tabloids reporting on his      |
| trysts. She has been running a realty company for several years, usually    |
| specializing in commercial properties, which has been lucrative thanks in   |
| part to the connections she had made rubbing elbows with the city's elite.  |
| The company will also occasionally handle residential properties. She was   |
| smart, capable, and powerful. The only flaw in the power of her personality |
| that she seemed to naturally project, was the fact that she was under the   |
| weather and had to excuse herself to the washroom over a bout of nausea when|
| she was first brought in.                                                   |
