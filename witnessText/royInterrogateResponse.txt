| You mention to Roy it seems like he had a side business set up to skim      |
| profits for himself and not his organization. "ok, detective, so I dipped   |
| my hand in the cookie jar, you can see how well it worked out for me. But   |
| I still had nothing to do with Emma's death. All I did was call her to let  |
| her know her boy Vince made a deal and then bolted on paying up. They were  |
| close, so I figured she could talk some sense to him before getting rough." |
