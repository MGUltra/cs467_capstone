| this case and I wont say anymore about it, except that if this finds its way|
| to the tabloids, I'll know exactly who to send my lawyers after. Even if it |
| would serve my husband right to be on the other side of the coin." She      |
| nearly spits the word husband more than speaks it to you. A media moguls    |
| wife having an affair with a former boxer would be a good reason to lie, but|
| it doesn't explain all of the clues. After all, the house purchase is real. |

| Interrogate Carl, if you can.                                               |
