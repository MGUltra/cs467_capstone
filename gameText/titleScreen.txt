"Listen up detective," the chief had a way of making you feel like you were 
back in grammar school. "As you all know, Emma, the lounge singer was murdered 
the other night. She was viciously bludgeoned, and you need to clear this one 
quick. We have three suspects in custody in the cells, all of whom not only have 
a past with Emma, but were seen with her as recently as the day she died. Along 
with the suspects are witnesses we've picked up who may have information about 
them. You'll have to go out to collect evidence from the suspects' houses, analyze 
that evidence, and then question the witnesses and suspects about anything 
interesting you find. Good Luck, detective!”
