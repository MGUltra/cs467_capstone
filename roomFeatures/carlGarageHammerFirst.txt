| Looking closer you see that this clawtooth hammer is 16oz, made by Stanley, |
| a widely used tool company. It's been well cared for - just a few nicks and |
| indentions on the head where nails were struck. Blood is flecked along the  |
| head and handle of the hammer.                                              |
