| The wooden chest looks somewhat out of place with the rest of the workshop	|
| items in Carl's garage. It is large and well cared for, probably used for 	|
| storage. There is a large lock on the front of it that will require a key to|
| open. While the garage is collecting saw dust on everything, the lock does	|
| not seem to have any collected, suggesting that it is routinely opened or at|
| least opened recently. look around Carl's house to see if he happens to keep| 
| the key around. 																														|
