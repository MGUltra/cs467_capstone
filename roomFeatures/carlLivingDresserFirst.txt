| The dresser is nothing special - the drawers only holding a few bits of     |
| paper, some spare change and a shoehorn. On top of the dresser is Carl's    |
| framed college diploma. There's also a picture of Carl and an older man &   |
| woman - possibly his parents.	There doesn't seem to be anything here.       |
