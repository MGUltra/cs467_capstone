| The pill bottle is an opaque orange - the kind you'd get from a pharmacy.   |
| Looking closer you read the label - the prescription is made out to Dan     |
| and calls for 6mg of Xanax, or 1 pill, per day. The prescription is dated   |
| three days ago, but there are definitely more than three pills missing.     |
