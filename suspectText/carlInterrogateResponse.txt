| Carl places his hands over his face and exhales deeply. "Ok, look, so Louise|
| and I are planning on starting out on our own. The bassinet I was building	|
| in the garage is for our baby that is on the way. Louise and I just always	|
| got along, and her husband is not interested in starting a family at his 		|
| age. He's still powerful and we were not planning on moving in together 		|
| until all out ducks were in a row and she filed for divorce. This situation	|
| is very delicate, so you can understand why we wouldn't be forthcoming." He	|
| stands with what looks like a weight off his shoulders to be telling the 		|
|	truth. Carl seems like a man unused to lying. "Emma was going to give us the|
| contact information for a private eye that she knew and was outside of the	|
| sphere of Louise's world so it wouldn't get back to her husband. That's why |
|	she was at my place earlier." Carl sat down on the bench in the cell and 		|
| leaned against the wall. The story matches up with all the evidence, and it	|
| is safe to say you can now clear Carl of the crime, even though he is not		|
| out of the woods in terms of the tribulations his personal life are about to|
| take on.																																		|
