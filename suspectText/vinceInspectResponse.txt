| Vince looks to stand about 6'4" - his frame filled out with large, well-    |
| defined muscles. Deep set eyes and a strong jawline define his face. His    |
| clothes are all top of the line and cling tightly to his body. He looks     |
| young, around mid twenties. We know he and Emma met a while ago when he was |
| a runner for a low level mobster. The word is they were only friends, and   |
| watched out for him like a kid brother. He got away from the mob before     |
| doing anything but running, but he may not have gone far as it seems he's in|
| on some sort of deal with Roy. He was seen arguing with Emma the day she was|
| murdered, and while he seems upset, he isn't being cooperative. Find some   |
| evidence to get Vince to talk.                                         			|
