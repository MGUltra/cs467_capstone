| Dan is on the short side - probably standing at 5'8". His dark brown hair   |
| is a bit unkempt, but matches his scraggly beard. He also seems to be       |
| slightly overweight, but this is somewhat hidden by his baggy clothing.     |
| The word is that Dan has been carrying a bit of a torch for Emma ever since |
| Their relationship ended, and just cant seem to move on or let go. He's even|
| gone up to her club a few times until security made it clear that he would  |
| be in a world of pain if he showed up there again.                          |
