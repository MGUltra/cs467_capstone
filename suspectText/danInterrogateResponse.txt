| sobbing. "I had no choice." Looks like he chose rage. "She couldn't just get|
| away with what she did to me. You can arrest me, but once the jury hears    |
| about how she hurt me, they'll never convict. You'll see." You glare at Dan |
| and briefly consider throwing him an old school police blanket party, but 	|
| decide he isn't worth it. Climbing the walls of a cement box for the rest of|
| his life can be his own personal hell.                                      |
|                                                                             |
