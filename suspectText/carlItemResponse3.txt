| Carl seems shaken at the sight of you holding his letters. "I have recieved |
| plenty of fan mail from women over the years, that's not really a surprise  |
| is it? That's just from a fan I was dating for a bit and it seemed rude to  |
| throw them away. And I dont know how Louise's DNA and prints could get on   |
| them, other than the fact that she has always helped me go through financial|
| documents, even in the start of my career. Her prints are probably on all of|
| the papers in my house." Carl's story could be true, but the stilted way he |
| tells it betrays a man with no confidence in the veracity of what he says.  |
