| Vince seems to deflate when I let him know that Roy has cracked and told me |
| about there little side action with the tip. "Yeah, I wasn't looking to rip |
| Roy off or anything until he wanted larger than a finders fee cut. He didn't|
| provide the backing funds or place the bet, which insulated him from his    |
| connections who might be a little unhappy that he didn't give them this tip.|
| He wasn't taking any risk and he wanted half, no way." When you ask about   |
| Emma, Vince gets somber. "Emma is the reason I got out of working for the   |
| outfit before I got in deep. She looked out for me and said I could do more |
| with my life, and if I got in with them, I'd be in for good. And she was    |
| right. I wasn't connected, but still new people, and when Roy offered an    |
| oppurtunity for a quick payday I took it. Roy called Emma when I didn't give|
| him what he wanted, and she was livid I was involved with a deal with a     |
| connected guy. I really hope this wasn't why she was killed." You explain to|
| Vince that there doesn't seem to be any connection to Emma's murder, and he |
| appears only slightly relieved. He is still taking her death hard. You have |
| collected enough evidence to clear Vince of this crime.                     |
