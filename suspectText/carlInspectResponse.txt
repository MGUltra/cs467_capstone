| Carl is middle-aged, and about 6'2", with heavy hands. It is not hard to 	  |
| guess that he was a boxer in his youth. While he never went pro, he won the |
| Golden Gloves tournament in '84 and turned that into several lucrative 		  |
| media appearances and endorsement deals. His star may have never risen above|
| that of a regional celebrity, but he has made a very comfortable living. 		|
| He was seen with Emma earlier in the day, and while they knew each other 		|
| from the promotional work he has done with the club she often sings at, his	|
| explanation for why they were together the day she was murdered leaves 			|
| you with the feeling that he knows something that he isn't telling you.			|
