| been the one to kill her, I was at home working on a project." Carl motions |
| to his bandaged hand. "That's how I did this. It was a carpentry accident." |

| a retired boxer. "Louise can vouch for me for part of the night, she was at |
| my place with the contract for the new house I'm buying."                   |
